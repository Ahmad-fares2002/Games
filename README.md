# Games
This repo has the games I made during my internship All the games are playable ads that deployed on different ad platforms such as Unity ads, Google admob, etc.  <br> 
You can play the games by downloading the folder you want, but for the Tile game it requests a local server, so you could upload it to the server or try it on the following link  <br>
