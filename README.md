# Games
This repo has the games I made during my internship All the games are playable ads that deployed on different ad platforms such as Unity ads, Google admob, etc. \n
You can play the games by downloading the folder you want, but for the Flubby bird and Tile game they may request a local server, so you could upload them to the server or try them on the following link \n
