# Games
This repo has the games I made during my internship All the games are playable ads that deployed on different ad platforms such as Unity ads, Google admob, etc.  <br> 
You can play the games by downloading the folder you want, but for the Tile game they may request a local server, so you could upload them to the server or try them on the following link  <br>
